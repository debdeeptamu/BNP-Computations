# Efficient Bayesian shape-constrained function estimation

R codes and function files for implementing the simulations and real data analysis addressed in the paper.

Description of the associated R-script files:

1. all_functions.R file contains all the required sub functions to incorporate Algorithm 1 of the paper, including functions like samp.WC    (draws a sample based on sampling scheme developed in Wood and Chan (1994)), ESS (draws a sample using elliptical slice sampler by        Murray et al. [2010]), nu.MH2 (draws posterior samples on the hyperparameters using Metropolis–Hastings and inverse Cholesky factor        utilizing Durbin’s recursion). One can find detailed description of each functions in the file.

For details on the code, refer to the associated R files.
